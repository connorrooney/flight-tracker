This project was conducted over a 2 1/2 day Sprint by me and another 2 Junior Devs. 

It's not complete but I quite like that it's an illustration of how far we got in such a short space of time. 

I will be picking it up again in the future, time allowing, and completing it as I think alot of the underlying work is done.

Our brief was: 

Kyle, Kieran & Connor, Your challenge is to create a flight tracker app Required features: 

• Mobile friendly (mobile first). 
• Arrival and departure times for any user-defined airport. 
• Show live position of flights. 
• Show more detailed information about selected planes. 
• For example: Plane’s flight path appears when it is selected 
• API: https://opensky-network.org
